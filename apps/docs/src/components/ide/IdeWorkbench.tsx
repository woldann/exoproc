/**
 * The persistent IDE shell for `/ide`: one activity-bar-driven sidebar and
 * one main content area, both mounted for as long as the route is, with
 * only their *contents* swapping when the active view changes.
 *
 * Explorer/Debugger/Snapshots used to each be their own route
 * (`/ide/explorer`, `/ide/debugger`, `/ide/snapshots`), each declaring its
 * own sidebar+main split from scratch (explorer's a resizable panel,
 * debugger's a fixed-width aside, snapshots' none at all -- its content
 * filled the whole width where the editor should have been). Switching
 * between them was a full Next.js route change: the entire sidebar+main
 * tree unmounted and remounted, which is why the sidebar's width visibly
 * jumped between tabs and why Snapshots looked like it replaced the file
 * editor instead of living beside it.
 *
 * Now the view is tracked as a `?view=` query param on this single route
 * (read here via `useSearchParams`, switched via `IdeActivityBar`'s
 * `<Link>`s -- a search-param-only navigation on the same route does not
 * remount the page). `<Panel id="ide-sidebar">`/`<Panel id="ide-main">`
 * below are declared exactly once and never remount across a view switch,
 * so their resize state persists. Each `use*View()` hook is still called
 * unconditionally every render (Rules of Hooks), which is a feature here:
 * the inactive views' background state (debugger's process-list polling,
 * snapshots' list subscription, explorer's open document) all stay warm,
 * so switching tabs never shows a fetch flash or loses in-progress state.
 *
 * `main` is *always* `explorerView.main` (editor + the tabbed Terminal/
 * Debug Logs/Output panel) now, regardless of `view` -- Debugger no longer
 * owns a separate main area (see `useDebuggerView`'s doc comment): while a
 * process/thread is attached, `useExplorerView` itself swaps the editor
 * pane's content for the read-only disassembly, driven by `debugSession`
 * below rather than by which sidebar tab is active. That's also why
 * attaching a debugger doesn't need `view` to be `'debugger'` at all --
 * switching to Explorer or Snapshots while a session is live still shows
 * the disassembly, exactly the "nothing else should change" behavior asked
 * for.
 *
 * `debugSession` is `useState`, not a route-derived value: `DebugSessionMount`
 * (rendered as an inert trailing sibling below, present only once `pid`/
 * `tid` are in the URL) reports it up via a callback rather than this
 * component reading the URL directly -- see that file's doc comment for
 * why a Context provider wrapping this component was the wrong shape.
