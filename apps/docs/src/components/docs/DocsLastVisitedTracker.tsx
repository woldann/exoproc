 *
 * Explicitly skips the bare `/[lang]/docs` path itself: this tracker is
 * mounted in `docs/layout.tsx`, which wraps that route too, so without this
 * guard, landing on bare `/docs` would immediately overwrite the cookie
 * with the bare path -- clobbering the real last-visited page before
 * `DocsHomeRedirect`'s own effect (a sibling, mounted in the same commit)
 * gets a chance to read it. That's a real bug this shipped with once: the
 * redirect used to be a server-side `redirect()` that never rendered this
 * layout's children at all, so the bare path could never reach here; once
 * that became a client-side redirect (`DocsHomeRedirect`, needed to avoid
 * a `next/headers` `cookies()` crash under Cloudflare Workers -- see its
 * own doc comment), this tracker started running for the bare path too and
 * the assumption silently broke.
