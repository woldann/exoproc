 * Registers one "View: Show X" command per view container, generated
 * from `viewContainerRegistry` rather than hand-listed -- the same
 * relationship VS Code's palette has to its own registered views. Adding
 * a new view container (a new `*.contribution.ts` importing
 * `registerViewContainer`) makes it searchable in the Command Palette
 * with no extra step.
 *
 * Navigation is a plain `window.location.assign`, not the Next.js
 * router's soft navigation -- a command handler is a bare function with
 * no React context to pull `useRouter()` from, and this workbench has
 * exactly two views, so the cost of a full navigation here is not worth
 * threading a router reference through command registration to avoid.
