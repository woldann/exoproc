/**
 * The renderer's own copy of `packages/simulate/src/platform/common/
 * event.ts`, restated rather than imported.
 *
 * This is not duplication for its own sake: `src/base/**`, `src/platform/
 * **` and `src/workbench/**` may not import `@exoproc/simulate` at all
 * (see the `no-restricted-imports` boundary in `eslint.config.mjs`), and
 * that boundary is what guarantees the renderer cannot reach the
 * simulation engine even by accident. `Emitter`/`Event`/`Disposable` are
 * simple enough (33 lines in the original) that copying them once here
 * costs far less than the alternative of weakening the boundary to let
 * one shared file through it.
