/**
 * The single source of truth for every channel name and every payload
 * shape that crosses the process boundary.
 *
 * Both sides import from here, so a rename or a payload change is a type
 * error on both ends rather than a runtime mismatch.
 *
 * ## Why these types are restated rather than imported
 *
 * This file is reachable from the renderer, so it may not import the
 * simulation engine -- not even for types. The unions below therefore
 * restate the engine's shapes instead of aliasing them. That is
 * deliberate: the contract belongs to the shell, not to the engine. The
 * main process asserts conformance at compile time (see
 * `main/modules/conformance.ts`), so if the engine ever drifts, it
 * breaks in the one place allowed to see both sides.
 *
 * ## What may appear in a payload
 *
 * The transport is `postMessage`, i.e. structured clone -- which handles
 * `bigint`, `Uint8Array`, `Map` and `Set` natively. So addresses stay
 * `bigint` and memory stays `Uint8Array`; there is no need to
 * string-encode anything the way an HTTP boundary would force. What may
 * *not* cross is anything live, cyclic, or unboundedly large: class
 * instances, the engine's CoW page tables, and whole mapping buffers.
