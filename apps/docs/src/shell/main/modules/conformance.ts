 * Compile-time guard against the contract and the engine drifting apart.
 *
 * `shell/common/channels.ts` restates the engine's string unions rather
 * than importing them, because it is reachable from the renderer and the
 * renderer may not see the engine. That restatement is only safe if
 * something checks it -- and the main process is the one place allowed
 * to look at both sides, so it checks it here.
 *
 * Add a register to the engine, or rename a thread state, and this file
 * stops compiling. That is the intended failure: it is far cheaper than
 * discovering the mismatch as a wrong value in the UI.
