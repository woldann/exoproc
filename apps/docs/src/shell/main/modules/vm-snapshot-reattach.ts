 * comment for the full "must never be serialized" list): the `node.dll`
 * syscall handlers, the workspace root, and -- conditionally --
 * `exoproc-ide.exe` itself. `fileSystem` content itself needs no
 * reattaching at all -- it came back from the snapshot directly (see
 * `Win32FileSystem.restoreState`) -- only the app-level "which absolute
 * path is the workspace root pointed at" state `workspace.ts` tracks
 * separately needs resetting, since the path selected before the restore
 * may not exist in the just-restored filesystem.
 *
 * Must NEVER call `registerJsHostPrograms()`/any `registerXHandlers()`
 * again: `ipc.handle()` throws on a duplicate channel registration ("a
 * bug, not a merge" -- see `shell/main/ipc.ts`), and every one of this
 * app's IPC handlers was already registered exactly once, synchronously,
 * at the Worker's original `main.ts` boot -- restoring the machine
 * singleton has no bearing on that separate, still-live registry at all.
