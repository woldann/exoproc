// activity bar's Docs button, view-container hrefs, ...) do the same via
// `localizedPath` below -- keep using it there rather than hand-rolling
// `` `/${lang}${path}` ``, or they'll drift from what fumadocs itself
// generates.
//
// fumadocs' own `hideLocale` support normally pairs this with middleware
// (`proxy.ts`) that rewrites an incoming unprefixed request onto
// `/tr/...` -- dropped because Next.js 16's proxy is Node.js-runtime-only,
// which OpenNext Cloudflare doesn't support. `next.config.mjs`'s
// `rewrites()` does that part instead (edge/Workers-compatible, no
// middleware needed), and additionally content-negotiates via the
// `Accept-Language` header so an unprefixed request actually lands on
// English for an English browser rather than always defaulting to
// Turkish (confirmed fumadocs' own middleware does not do this for
// `hideLocale: 'default-locale'` -- it hardcodes the default language
// unconditionally for a bare path; the negotiation this app wants is
// bespoke, not something disabling middleware merely lost).
// `parser: 'dir'` expects one subfolder per locale under `content/docs`
// (`content/docs/tr/...`, `content/docs/en/...`).
