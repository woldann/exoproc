# Getting started

Exoproc is a TypeScript/Bun toolkit for cross-process instrumentation on Windows x64. It can read and write target memory, run calls on an existing target thread, and hook function entries.

## Requirements

- Bun 1.3 or later
- Windows x64; Wine can be used for development and testing
- Access rights appropriate for the target process

```bash
bun install
bun run build
bun test
```

Use a target you control and can restart. A Linux setup running tests through Wine is supported, but a local Windows target requires Windows Bun.

## Your first accessor

For most uses, start with `createAccessor(processId)`. By default it tries the process's candidate threads, selects the first successful redirection, and returns an initialized accessor. Do not call `init()` again on that returned object.

```ts
import { createAccessor, Kernel32Impl } from 'exoproc';

const memory = await createAccessor(processId, {
  hostOptions: { timeoutMs: 20_000 },
});

try {
  const threadId = await memory.call(Kernel32Impl.GetCurrentThreadId);
  console.log(`Call ran on target thread ${threadId}`);

  const address = await memory.alloc(64);
  try {
    await memory.write(address, Buffer.from('hello'));
    console.log((await memory.read(address, 5)).toString());
  } finally {
    await memory.free(address);
  }
} finally {
  await memory.deinit();
}
```

`alloc`, `write`, `read`, and `call` use the same accessor chain here. `deinit()` is the normal exit path: it restores the captured thread context and closes accessor resources.

## Core concepts

`bun-xffi` provides the cross-process FFI, type, memory, and call foundation. `bun-winapi` wraps Win32 objects. `bun-nthread` runs calls without creating a remote thread. Hook packages build on those layers.

Remote work is more fragile than ordinary application code: a bad address, type, signature, or thread choice can crash the target. Continue with [NThread](/en/nthread/overview) and [troubleshooting](/en/troubleshooting) before using a non-test target.
