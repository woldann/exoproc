# NHook and MinHook

Exoproc provides two inline-hook models. The choice depends on the target prologue, detour requirement, and runtime behavior you can accept.

| Feature           | NHook                                            | MinHook                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Patch             | Two-byte `EB FE`                                 | At least a five-byte relative `jmp`       |
| Hit flow          | Thread parks; host discovers it through `poll()` | Detour runs directly in the target        |
| Original prologue | Supported instructions are simulated by the host | Relocated into a trampoline               |
| Detour            | Built-in JS hit/resume model                     | Caller-supplied address or `CMachineCode` |

NHook parks a thread at the function entry and has the host resume it after processing a hit. It has no conventional trampoline, but not every prologue can be simulated. MinHook relocates sufficient instructions into a trampoline; `create()` does not patch the target, while `enable(detour)` installs the jump. A distant detour uses a near relay, and MinHook does not define how a detour communicates with JavaScript.
