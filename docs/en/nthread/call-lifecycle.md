# NThread call lifecycle

One `NThread` redirects exactly one OS thread for its lifetime. With the factory path, thread selection happens during initialization and `createAccessor()` resolves only after that work completes.

In the slowed model below, each clock edge advances one instruction. Rather than displaying every code region at once, the disassembly window follows `RIP` between native code, separate stub locations in different modules, and a demo target. Its nine instruction groups and memory addresses are deterministic teaching data, not addresses read from a running process.

Initialization waits for the required system-stub scans, suspends the thread once to capture the `INTEGER`, `CONTROL`, and `FLOATING_POINT` context groups, then resumes it once into the running `EB FE` spin loop. For readability, the simulator shows `RIP`, `RSP`, `RAX`, `RBX`, `RBP`, `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8`, and `R9`; its NThread side handles those nine fields only through `getContext()` and `setContext()`. The real snapshot also contains XMM state. Restoring context cannot undo lock semantics or memory side effects produced by a call.

Outside that initial `SuspendThread()` and `ResumeThread()` pair, the call path does not touch the thread's suspend count. Because `EB FE` changes neither registers nor memory, NThread can safely read and modify the context while the thread is running at spin.

`savedContext` is copied twice during initialization. The first copy preserves the original `RIP` and selected jump-register value while the thread is initially suspended. After the `jumpStub → spinStub` landing, NThread clones the live context again while the thread runs at spin, then patches that second copy's `RIP` and jump-register field with the original values. The working snapshot therefore reflects the spin state while deinitialization can still release the thread at its captured instruction. The simulator's `CONTEXT BUS` and `0/2 → 2/2 COPIES` indicators visualize this sequence.

NThread leaves a full page below the captured stack pointer before selecting its call workspace:

```text
stackBegin = align16(capturedRsp - 4096)
callRsp    = stackBegin - 136

example: capturedRsp = 0x000000A418F8C8C0
         stackBegin  = 0x000000A418F8B8C0
         callRsp     = 0x000000A418F8B838
```

The 4096-byte slack reduces the chance that stale dispatch pointers left in stack memory collide early with ordinary stack use after deinitialization. Stack memory itself is not restored.

## Two-stage return chain

NThread constructs its normal call return path by executing `push reg; ret` in two stages. Stage A uses `RSP = callRsp + 56` and `push spinStub; ret`, establishing the spin stub slot at `[callRsp + 48]`. Stage B uses `RSP = callRsp + 8` and `push addRsp28RetStub; ret`; its first return enters `add rsp, 0x28; ret` and its second return reaches the spin stub slot.

`add rsp, 0x28` executes between the two `ret` instructions. These two return jumps exercise the normal zero-stack-argument return route before a user call is dispatched. Landing at the expected destination after both returns establishes and validates the cleanup, shadow-space skip, and known running spin state that later calls rely on for stability. Initialization fails if either stage does not return to spin as expected.

## One call

While the thread is running in the `EB FE` loop at `spinStub`, NThread reads its context with `getContext()`, prepares arguments and any required stack slots, then uses `setContext()` to point `RIP` at the target. The call path does not invoke `SuspendThread()` or `ResumeThread()`. After the target returns through the cleaner chain, the poller observes `RIP == spinStub` and reads the result from context. Between calls, the enabled thread remains running in the spin loop rather than roaming through native application code.

Calls with more than four parameters use an additional stack-cleanup stub. NThread attempts to write the basic zero-stack-argument return chain back after such a call. `call()` polls asynchronously; `callSync()` busy-spins the JavaScript thread without yielding and is suitable only for near-immediate calls. A timeout means the thread did not return to the known spin point, not merely that a function was slow.

## Cleanup and failure

`deinit()` reapplies the saved context while the thread is running at spin, allowing execution to continue from the original `RIP` without another resume; it then frees temporary stack-argument stubs and closes the thread handle. Always deinitialize in `finally`. Do not blindly reuse an accessor after a timeout or thread death because the thread's live state may be unknown.

If an automatic demo call is in flight, the simulator's **Disable** control waits for that call to return to spin before showing `deinit()`. That ordering belongs to the UI; production lifecycle ownership must avoid racing `call()` against `deinit()`.
