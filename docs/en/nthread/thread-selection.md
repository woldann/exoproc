# Thread selection

NThread drives one target thread for its entire lifetime, so selection is a stability decision, not just a performance choice.

| `idType`              | Meaning    | Behavior                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `thread`              | Thread ID  | Uses that specific thread.                                                        |
| `process`             | Process ID | Uses the process's first enumerable thread.                                       |
| `processAllThreadIds` | Process ID | Races all candidates; the first successful redirection wins. This is the default. |

Avoid UI message-loop threads, loader/startup threads, long-running lock holders, dying threads, and the driving thread of a NHook memory accessor. A race winner is merely a thread that completed redirection; it is not proof that the target's semantics are safe.

Start with the default in a controlled process, log the winner through `.nthread.threadId`, and move to `idType: 'thread'` only when you understand the target's threading model.
