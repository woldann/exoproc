# Using an NThread-backed accessor

Most users should not construct `IndirectNThreadHostAccessor` directly. `createAccessor()` builds and initializes the default chain. Its default `idType` is `processAllThreadIds`: the supplied ID is a PID, candidate threads are tried concurrently, and the first successful redirection wins.

```ts
import { createAccessor } from 'exoproc-accessors';

const memory = await createAccessor(processId, {
  hostOptions: { timeoutMs: 5_000, pollIntervalMs: 2 },
});

try {
  // use memory.alloc(), read(), write(), and call()
} finally {
  await memory.deinit();
}
```

Use `idType: 'thread'` when you deliberately select a known thread. `idType: 'process'` selects the first enumerable thread and offers no suitability guarantee. `callSync()` busy-spins the calling JavaScript thread; reserve it for calls that return almost immediately.
