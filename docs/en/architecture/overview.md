# Architecture overview

Except for the common helpers in `exoproc-utils`, `bun-xffi` is Exoproc's functional foundation: **x** means cross-process and **ffi** is the C ABI, type, and call layer. Other packages build Windows objects, thread redirection, and hooks on that model.

Application / example

  nhook · minhook
        │
accessors / nthread
        │
winapi (Windows process, thread, context, memory wrappers)
        │
 xffi (cross-process FFI: C ABI, structs, accessors, calls and memory)
        │
Windows x64
```

## The accessor chain

`IMemoryAccessor`, defined by `bun-xffi`, is the common surface for `read`, `write`, `alloc`, `free`, `scan`, and `call`. A struct therefore does not need to know whether its data is local, in another process, or reached through NThread.

`bun-xffi` is not only a wrapper around local `bun:ffi`: it makes structs, pointers, C functions, and accessor operations compose across process boundaries. `IndirectNThreadHostAccessor` places NThread beneath a middleware chain for call redirection, machine-code pooling, transfer, scanning, and ABI marshalling.
