# Accessor chain

An accessor presents the same `read`, `write`, `alloc`, `free`, `protect`, `scan`, and `call` operations through different memory-access strategies. It keeps local-versus-remote decisions out of structs and higher-level features.

```text
Struct / CFunction
        │
IMemoryAccessor
        │
Middleware
        │
Local API | Remote API | NThread redirection
```

`IndirectNThreadHostAccessor` uses NThread as its call executor and layers indirect call redirection, a machine-code pool, memset/memcmp transfer, file transfer, scanning, and ABI marshalling on top.

Its lifecycle matters. `createAccessor()` waits for `init()` and returns a ready chain. If you construct `IndirectNThreadHostAccessor` directly, await `init()` before use; do not assume that a generic accessor exposes a `whenReady()` method. When debugging, identify the layer that actually executed the operation before diagnosing a timeout or ABI symptom.
