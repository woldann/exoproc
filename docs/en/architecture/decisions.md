# Design decisions

## Why accessors?

Making every `Struct` or `CFunction` choose local and remote APIs leaks transport details into higher layers. Accessors keep those details below a reusable common interface.

## Why system stubs?

For redirection, NThread finds small instruction sequences in loaded system modules: `EB FE`, `push reg; ret`, `jmp reg`, `ret`, and `add rsp, 0x28; ret`. This avoids placing one large fixed execution payload just to redirect a thread. It does not mean the whole system is allocation-free: accessor middleware and stack-argument cleanup can still allocate target memory.

## Why two hook models?

NHook patches two bytes with `EB FE`, parks entering threads, and lets the host process a hit. MinHook uses a five-byte relative jump and a relocated trampoline. The former depends on hit lifecycle and instruction simulation; the latter depends on relocation, near allocation, and a usable detour. Neither is a universal replacement for the other.
