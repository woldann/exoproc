# Windows x64 ABI and NThread

NThread must establish a valid Windows x64 register and stack state, not merely jump to a correct address.

## The first four arguments are positional

Argument position chooses the register slot. Integer/pointer slots are `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8`, and `R9`; floating-point slots at the same positions are `XMM0`–`XMM3`. In a mixed signature, a second `f64` is in `XMM1`, not `XMM0`.

NThread writes normalized `f32` and `f64` arguments to the corresponding XMM slot and mirrors their bits into the matching general-purpose register field. Further arguments are stack slots. Integer/pointer returns come from `RAX`; floating-point returns come from `XMM0`.

## Stack and return chain

The caller reserves 32 bytes of shadow space and preserves 16-byte alignment. NThread uses a workspace below the captured `RSP` and returns through an `add rsp, 0x28; ret` chain to its spin stub. Calls with more than four arguments use a temporary `add rsp, 0x28 + N*8; ret` cleanup stub.

Verify signatures before calling. Varargs, structs by value, SIMD/vector types, unusual conventions, and non-returning functions require controlled testing. If `expectedRsp` is set, NThread checks it after both async `call()` and `callSync()`.
