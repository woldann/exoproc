/**
 * A {@link HostAccessor} whose base "call" mechanism is {@link NThread} (x64
 * thread redirection) instead of `RemoteCallableMemoryAccessor` (a fresh
 * `CreateRemoteThread` per call). This directly replaces the old
 * `IndirectCallableAccessor` + manual `NThread`/`RedirectorHostAccessor`
 * wiring -- it builds the same indirect chain
 * (`IndirectCallRedirectorAccessor` → machineCode pool → memset write →
 * memcmp read → file-transfer R/W → scanner → marshalling) on top of an
 * `NThread`-*like* backend directly.
 *
 * Only the thing that actually executes remote calls changes: no
 * `CreateRemoteThread` at all -- a live thread in the target is redirected,
 * parked at a `jmp $` stub, and driven per call. This also sidesteps a
 * GHA/Wine bug where WinAPI calls (VirtualAlloc, malloc, fopen, ...) executed
 * on a freshly-created thread (local or remote) are unreliable -- see CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * Accepts an already-constructed `NThread`, a `(pid, threadId, options)`
 * triple to build one internally, or a {@link NThreadRaceAccessor} standing
 * in for a not-yet-known winner among every thread of a process (the
 * `idType: 'processAllThreadIds'` support behind `createAccessor` --  see
 * that class's own doc comment):
 *
 *   const memory = new IndirectNThreadHostAccessor(pid, tid);
 *   const addr = await memory.alloc(64);              // VirtualAlloc via redirect
 *   await memory.call(SomeFunc, addr);                // executed on the thread
 *
 *   const race = new NThreadRaceAccessor(pid);
 *   const memory = new IndirectNThreadHostAccessor(race); // built once, synchronously
 *   await memory.init();                                  // races, resolves `race` internally
 *
 * With the `(pid, threadId, options)` form, this accessor builds the
 * `NThread`'s `RedirectorHostAccessor` root itself and wires its `target`
 * to `this` -- it owns that object, nothing else could reach it.
 *
 * With the `backend: NThread | NThreadRaceAccessor` form, the backend (and
 * whatever `root` it was constructed with) belongs to the caller. This
 * accessor does not reach into its `root` to rewire it -- if its bootstrap
 * stub calls need to route through this indirect chain (e.g. `root` is a
 * `RedirectorHostAccessor`), the caller sets `root.target = indirect` itself
 * after construction, same as building the chain by hand:
 *
 *   const redirector = new RedirectorHostAccessor(pid);
 *   const nthread = new NThread(backend, tid, options, redirector);
 *   const indirect = new IndirectNThreadHostAccessor(nthread);
 *   redirector.target = indirect;

   * `RedirectorHostAccessor`) is the winning `NThread` by the time `init()`
   * resolves (see its doc comment), so this drills through to it rather
   * than exposing the race stand-in itself -- callers that reach past the

 * chain gets built exactly once, synchronously, right alongside every other
 * `idType`; only the actual thread hijack is deferred to `init()`, same as
 * the rest of this class's own machinery.
 *
 * Extends {@link RacingHostAccessor} and overrides its `onInit()` to
 * actually race (`this.race()`), then sets its own `target` to the winning
 * `NThread` directly -- so every op this class forwards (inherited from
 * `RedirectorHostAccessor`) transparently reaches the winner from then on,
 * with nothing above it (in `IndirectNThreadHostAccessor`'s own chain) ever
 * needing to change.
 *
 * Only initializes the *raw* `NThread` hijack per candidate, not a full
 * `IndirectNThreadHostAccessor` chain -- that chain is built exactly once,
 * around *this* accessor rather than around any particular candidate, so the
 * real extra work beyond landing the hijack (`IndirectCallRedirectorAccessor`,
 * `MachineCodePoolMiddleware`, an msvcrt check, opening a remote temp file for
 * `FileTransferWriteAccessor`, ...) naturally only ever happens once, no
 * matter which candidate wins.
 *
 * Every candidate `NThread` is built with `this` (the single, shared
 * `NThreadRaceAccessor`) as its root directly -- no per-candidate proxy
 * object. That's normally unsafe: `NThread.onInit()`'s bootstrap
 * (`this.root.call(stubs.jumpStub)`, landing the hijack) needs `root.call()`
 * to resolve back to *that exact candidate's* own `call()`, and with N
 * candidates racing concurrently through one shared root, a single mutable
 * `backend`/`target` field can't hold N different answers at once (tried
 * this with a plain shared root first -- every candidate's bootstrap call
 * collided on the same placeholder and threw). The fix is `currentCandidate`
 * above: `startRacer` (below) wraps each candidate's `init()` in
 * `currentCandidate.run(candidate, ...)`, which threads that candidate
 * through its *entire* async continuation (every `await` inside its own
 * `onInit()`) in a context isolated from every other concurrently-racing
 * candidate. `call()` (below), when `target` is still self (race not yet
 * decided), reads `currentCandidate.getStore()` to find out which
 * candidate's own bootstrap call this is and forwards to *its* `call()`
 * directly -- no shared field involved. This keeps the ALS mechanism
 * entirely local to this class (`RacingHostAccessor` itself knows nothing
 * about it, see its doc comment) and needs zero changes to `NThread` --
 * `this.root.call(...)` there is untouched, so root-indirection stays a
 * generic, reusable mechanism, not something hardcoded around racing.
