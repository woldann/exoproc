/**
 * Dedicated background worker for `waitAsync` (see `waiter.ts`). Runs a
 * single `WaitForMultipleObjects` loop over the shared handle table -- a
 * real OS wait, not a poll -- and reports back one of three outcomes per
 * slot: `'signaled'`, `'timeout'`, or `'error'`. See `waiter-shared.ts` for
 * the table layout and the wake-slot protocol.
 *
 * Timeouts are enforced by the kernel, not a JS timer: each occupied slot
 * carries an absolute deadline in the shared table, and every loop iteration
 * passes `WaitForMultipleObjects` the number of milliseconds until the
 * *nearest* one (or `INFINITE` if none have one). This is deliberately not a
 * JS `setTimeout` on the main thread -- a real Windows kernel wait timeout
 * can't be delayed by either thread being busy, whereas a JS timer can (see
 * the bisection comment below for exactly how that bit us).
 *
 * Deliberately self-contained: no imports from the rest of the package, just
 * `bun:ffi`'s own `dlopen` against `kernel32.dll` directly for the one
 * symbol this needs (`kernel32.dll` is always loaded in every Windows
 * process, so a plain `dlopen` resolves it with no compile step at all --
 * faster to start than routing through the rest of the package's
 * `cimport`/TCC machinery, which exists to solve linker issues for arbitrary
 * DLLs that don't apply here). This file is bundled as its own `bun build`
 * entry point (see `scripts/build.ts`) so it can be loaded standalone via
 * `new Worker(...)`, independent of whether the rest of the package is
 * running from `dist/` (bundled) or live `src/` (tests).

 * `WaitForMultipleObjects` itself.
 *
 * This is what makes the WAIT_FAILED path self-terminating: every call to
 * this function evicts at least one bad slot (`slots.length >= 1` and
 * `WaitForMultipleObjects` just failed on it, so isolation always finds
 * something), which is what a naive "just retry" loop can't guarantee --
