/**
 * Waits for `handle` to signal, or `timeoutMs` to elapse (pass a negative

 *
 * Backed by a dedicated worker that runs a single `WaitForMultipleObjects`
 * loop (a real OS wait, not a poll) over a table of handles shared with this
 * thread via a `SharedArrayBuffer`. Registering a new wait writes the handle
 * *and its absolute deadline* into a free slot and `SetEvent`s a reserved
 * wake handle (slot 0), which kicks the worker's blocking call so it picks
 * up the updated table. The worker itself derives its `WaitForMultipleObjects`
 * timeout from the nearest deadline across all occupied slots and reports
 * back one of three outcomes per slot -- `'signaled'`, `'timeout'`, or
 * `'error'` (the handle became invalid, isolated via bisecting repeated
 * `WaitForMultipleObjects` calls -- see `waiter-worker.ts`) -- which this
 * resolves that slot's promise with. Because the kernel enforces the
 * timeout, not a JS timer on either thread, it can't be delayed by either
 * thread being busy. A per-slot generation counter guards against a stale
 * report (e.g. for a slot since reallocated) resolving the wrong caller.
 *
 * Falls back to the old non-blocking `WaitForSingleObject(handle, 0)` poll
 * loop when the shared table is full (`WaitForMultipleObjects` itself caps
 * out at 64 handles) -- see `waitAsyncPolling`.
